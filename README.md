# Anomaly-Detection
The project aims at identification of anomalies or outliers and approaching the problem using the best algorithm available. This helps to deal with the counterfacual arguements which is extremely important in the data storytelling.

The beginning of this journey involves the use of K-Nearest-Neighbours method to identify the outliers in the industrial data which contains readings of different preheaters as observations in the interval of five minutes. 

Note: This was just the beginning and we wish to learn every possible methods for our purpose.
