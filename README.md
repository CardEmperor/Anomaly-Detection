# Anomaly-Detection
The project aims at identification of anomalies or outliers and approaching the problem using the best algorithm available. This helps to deal with the counterfacual arguements which is extremely important in the data storytelling.

The beginning of this journey involves the use of K-Nearest-Neighbours method with limited Exploratory Analysis to identify the outliers in the industrial data which contains readings of different preheaters as observations in the interval of five minutes. 

## About the data
The file Exactdata.xlsx contains data in XLSX format. The file can be [downloaded at this URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PyiF6qyLRcM0PnlQHMbthf4BHqS2nbi9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108921162588745947158&rtpof=true&sd=true).

> Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp, Cyclone_Material_Temp, Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft, Cyclone_cone_draft, Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp, Cyclone_Inlet_Draft, time are the different variables observed at interval of five minutes.

The emphasis is mainly on the Imputation, EDA, models in order to understand "What do we know, What have we learnt" and "Why what we don't know matters" as [David.J.Hand](https://www.amazon.in/Dark-Data-What-Dont-Matters/dp/069118237X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HSGMRARHCO1L&keywords=dark+data&qid=1641273338&sprefix=dark+dat%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-1) puts it.

Note: This was just the beginning and we wish to learn every possible methods for our purpose.
